Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. We first observed the sample.png, there it was clear that the input image that we would get will be tiny.
2. We found out that the input image is 50*50 pixels.
3. Then we used the open cv library to extract those images.
4. The challenge was to extract the images in the correct order thus we first found the coordinates of the windows and then arranged the extracted images in a specified order inside a list.
5. We cropped out the white frame in the images.
6 . Using this method on our previous model from taskb we found that accuracy was very low, the reason being our model was overly complex for 50 * 50 images
7. Thus we need to retrain the model.
8. We resized the complete training dataset to 50 * 50, then trained VGG - 16 feature extractor with a relatively small dense layer.
9. Then while training we got around 90% accuracy.
10. Then we used that newly trained model on the taskc.
